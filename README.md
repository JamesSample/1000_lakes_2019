# "1000 Lakes" 2019

## Project planning (prior to sampling)

 * **[Proposed sampling locations](https://jamessample.github.io/1000_lakes_2019/)**. Map showing the lakes to be sampled during 2019 (together with protected areas and reindeer grazing regions)
 
 ## Data handling (after sampling)
 
  * **[Quality checking and assurance](https://github.com/NIVANorge/1000_lakes_qc#data-visualisation-for-the-2019-1000-lakes-survey)**. Maps and charts used for quality assurance are availabe in a separate repository
  
  * **[Linking RESA to Aquamonitor](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/1000_lakes_2019/blob/master/01_link_to_resa.ipynb)**. Comparing and correcting station metadata from the 1995 and 2019 surveys
  
  * **[Climate data processing](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/1000_lakes_2019/blob/master/02_era5_data.ipynb)**. Extracting [ERA5](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels-monthly-means?tab=overview) climate data for the 1000 Lakes sampling locations

  * **[Deposition data processing](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/1000_lakes_2019/blob/master/notebooks/03_nilu_dep_data.ipynb)**. Extracting atmospheric deposition values for N and (non-marine) S for the 1000 Lakes sampling locations. Based on datasets previously supplied by NILU and stored in the Critical Loads database
